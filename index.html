      <div>
        <p> Women's Day is observed every year to honour the contributions of women across 
            diverse fields. The day serves to raise awareness about gender equality, promote
             empowerment, and advocate for equal pay. It also recognizes women's social,
              economic, cultural, and political accomplishments while championing their rights
               worldwide.
